# Backlog

### Task 1 : Task estimation and documentation (1 point) (1 hour)
* Creation of the tasks
* Estimation of the tasks
* Write the tasks in the backlog

### Task 2: Creation of the sub classes (2 points) (1 hour)
* Creation of the 3 sub classes (Rubric, Criterion, StudentGrade)
* Development of the unit tests for these classes

### Task 3: Creation of the controller class (3 points) (2 hours)
* Creation of the controller class
* Development of all the required methods
* Development of the unit tests

### Task 4: Implementation of the test coverage tool (2 points) (1 hour)
* Research and implementation of the test coverage tool
* Using it to measure the coverage and write the results\

**The first estimation** of the tasks has been made with points.
The points does not represent any amount of time but the estimated difficulty of the task, regardless the competencies of the developer.
The difficulty has been estimated regarding the technical requirements of the task and the level of competencies required.
The creation of the controller class is the most difficult task because it is the most technically demanding, this is where all the methods are implemented and it requires to assemble all of the sub classes

**The time estimation** has been made in function of the previous points estimation, but this time taking into consideration the skills of the developer.
I have experience in programming, but I never practiced Java, which is why I allowed that much time in the development, and in the implementation of a test coverage tool

**The velocity metric of the sprint** is an indicator of the efficiency and productivity of the sprint
To calculate the velocity metric, we have to determine the total amount of points that have been completed during the sprint (in our case: 1+2+3+2=8)
Calculating that metric in all the sprints allows the team to update at every end on sprint the average number of story points that the team completes in one sprint.
The more sprints the team did, the more accurate the metric will be.
