# SQA-FinalAssignment

You are going to create a software component for storing information about student grades. Each topic that a student is graded on has a Rubric. A Rubric is made up of multiple Criteria (up to a maximum of 10). When a student is graded they are awarded a score for each Criterion in the Rubric, which is an integer value between 1 and 5.

Here's an example to help you visualise the problem. Each of the columns is a Criterion for this Rubric (Design, Implementation, Testing, Documentation). The rows below capture the score of each student for each criterion.

## Setup

The project has been developed in the Intellij Idea IDE, using java16 and junit5

## Test coverage

The test coverage has been measured by the Intellij integrated coverage tool
To run the test coverage tool, press the "Run 'project' with coverage button

All the methods of the project have an associated Unit test :
